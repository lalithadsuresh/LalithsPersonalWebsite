                            I've always been drawn to storytelling, beginning with writing and actingâ€”both of which I still do.
                            But when I discovered technology, it quickly became my favorite medium to connect with people. 
                            I found myself communicating visual poetry in powerful, innovative ways. Whether through React components, API integrations, or unique front-end designs, 
                            I strive to create software that prioritizes user flow to ensure that users feel recognized and connected.
